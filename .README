### An android mobile application developed using React Native
## Building:
Install expo on your machine if you do not have it installed already.
Run > npm install to install all required dependencies.

## Running:
To view the app, use an android emulator. I used a Pixel 5 AVD and ran it inside android studio.
Run expo run:android from the root directory of the app, other commands will not work.
